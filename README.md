# Pacman-Factory
A simple two button web application that uses one button to generate pacmen, while another button starts their movement and sends them bouncing around the window at random speeds.

# How to Run:
* Download repository.
  * Make sure you have an images folder with the pacman.png's and that the folder is in the same directory and level as the html, css, and javascript files.
* Open html file in browser.
* To generate Pacmen, hit the "Add Pacman" Button. To start their movement, hit the green "Start" button.

Roadmap of future improvements: 
* Make it so as the pacmen move they open and close their mouths, as well as change direction when hitting a window edge.
* Ensure that they do not populate above the buttons when randomly generated.
* Create a button that stops their movement.
* Create a button that resets the game.
